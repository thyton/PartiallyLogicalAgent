# PartiallyLogicalAgent
### The project includes:
  - Building a randomized maze generator to create a survival-game-liked environment
  - Building a knowledge base for the logical agent
  - Adding the agent's ability to prioritize and infer actions from its perception using pyPL which is a propositional logic interface/interpreter that I wrote from scratch https://github.com/thyton/pyPL
  - Adding a modified A* algorithm to help the agent travel through the environment optimally
